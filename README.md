The SHEMMAN code is a FORTRAN code, that provides calculation using rigid non-axial model, DavydovFillipov, Davydov-Chaban, or soft-rotator models with
different options of consideration of octupole and hexadecapole deformations. It reads soft-rotator Hamiltonian parameters and set of levels described by their
quantum numbers. As a result levels energies are calculated with possible calculation of Î³-transition probabilities and matrix elements of different deformation
operators used by OPTMAN.

Another important variant of program usage is fitting of Hamiltonian parameters to reproduce experimental level structure.
